The purpose of this project is to get the basic understanding about different functions and commands of OpenGL and get familiar with their implementation in C++. With the help of this project, I was able to understand how to initialize a new glut window of specific size, position and mode, how to draw some basic shapes of different color and sizes as well as about the co-ordinate system of OpenGL.  
This scenery is filled with greyscale color scheme.
