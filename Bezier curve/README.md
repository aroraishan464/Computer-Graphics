In computer graphics, we often need to draw different types of objects onto the screen. Objects are not flat all the time and we need to draw curves many times to draw an object. One of the way to draw such curves is Bezier curve. Bezier curve is discovered by the French engineer **Pierre BÃ©zier**. These curves can be generated under the control of other points. Approximate tangents by using control points are used to generate curve. In this program, a panda is created using Bezier curves and it is filled using flood fill algorithm.
## Usage
- Build and run the code. A glut window will open on the screen.
- Left click on the screen to draw the panda along with word PANDA below it.
- Right click anywhere in the window to fill the panda with black color and to fill each letter of the word PANDA with a random color
