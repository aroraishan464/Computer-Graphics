# Computer Graphics 
Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures, lines, charts, etc. using computers with the help of programming.
Computer graphics is made up of number of pixels. Pixel is the smallest graphical picture or unit represented on the computer screen.
All the programs here are implemented in C++ language with OpenGL library.

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform, language-independent, industrial standard API for producing 3D (including 2D) graphics. 
The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.
## Setup
Every program in this repository is made and tested on windows platform in Code::Blocks IDE. With the help of this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtE0KdAeF9w)
, I setup OpenGL in Code::blocks.
